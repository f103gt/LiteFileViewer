# First Level Heading

Paragraph.

## Lab 1
Unit tests are located in ./tests. To find the uml diagrams, follow to ./diagrams. There implemented 4 of them -
Use Case, Class, Activity.
Also I made a great use of one of my previous pojects located in this repository https://github.com/f103gt/bookstore.git.
This project implements books microservice using instead of rest controllers, gRpc services to establish inter process
communication IPC with other micorservices.
The implemented UML diagrams are the following Deployment, Communication,

## Lab 2 (7 Patterns)

### Tempalate 
FileViwer is as a template for all 

### Factory

### Singleton - used to make sure that every instace of class that implemets FileViewer is created only once and used 
throughout the whole application.

### Strategy

### Composite

### Command (ZoomCommand)

## Books Management microservice

### Modle Viewer Control (MVC) - general structure of how the application works.

### Data Transfer Object (DTO) - used to trasfer data between Request Entity (gRpc message)
and Database Entity.

Paragraph.

- bullet
+ other bullet
* another bullet
    * child bullet

1. ordered
2. next ordered

## Lab3 (Multithreading)

Used in **manwindow.cpp** to oben the files. Considering that some files can take a lot for time
to be actually opened, mulithreading was introduced to make sure that several files can be 
opened simultaneously and the application remains responsive during the process of file leading.

Some *italic* and **bold** text and `inline code`.

An empty line starts a new paragraph.

Use two spaces at the end  
to force a line break.

A horizontal ruler follows:

---

Add links inline like [this link to the Qt homepage](https://www.qt.io),
or with a reference like [this other link to the Qt homepage][1].

    Add code blocks with
    four spaces at the front.

> A blockquote
> starts with >
>
> and has the same paragraph rules as normal text.
